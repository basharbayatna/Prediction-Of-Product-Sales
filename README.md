# Prediction of Product Sales üçéüõí
## Sales Prediction for Food Items

This project focuses on predicting the sales of food items across various stores.  
The goal is to help retailers understand the properties of products and outlets that play a crucial role in increasing sales.  
Additionally, this analysis aims to answer some **critical business questions** to guide strategic decisions, such as which outlet types and locations maximize sales, which outlets are most reliable, and where to focus expansion efforts for optimal profitability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Data Cleaning
Using **Pandas** to prepare the dataset for analysis:
1. Checked the number of rows and columns  
2. Inspected datatypes of each variable  
3. Removed duplicates  
4. Identified missing values and replaced them with placeholder values  
5. Ensured there are no missing values after cleaning  
6. Standardized categorical entries (e.g., fixing inconsistencies in `Item_Fat_Content`)  
7. Generated summary statistics for numerical features (min, max, mean, etc.)

## üìà Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to explore the dataset:

- **Histograms** ‚Üí visualize distributions of numerical features  
- **Boxplots** ‚Üí show statistical summaries and detect outliers  
- **Countplots** ‚Üí check frequency distributions of categorical features  
- **Heatmap** ‚Üí examine correlations between numerical variables

- **Tier 3:** ~3,400 outlets (highest)  
- **Tier 2:** ~2,800 outlets  
- **Tier 1:** ~2,400 outlets (lowest)  

> **Insight:** Tier 3 outlets are the most common, but this plot doesn‚Äôt indicate sales performance.

#### Plot 2: Outlet_Location_Type vs. Item_Outlet_Sales
<img width="589" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fec295c-21b2-4925-9cdb-2d09e9e194fc" />

- **Tier 3:** Highest median sales, wide spread, some outliers > $12,000  
- **Tier 1 & Tier 2:** Lower median sales, fewer extreme outliers  

> **Insight:** Tier 3 outlets not only are most frequent but also tend to generate the **highest sales**, showing a strong link between location tier and performance.

- **Supermarket Type 1:** most common, >5,000 outlets  
- **Supermarket Type 2, Grocery Store, Supermarket Type 3:** ~1,000 each  

> **Insight:** The dataset is heavily skewed towards Supermarket Type 1 outlets.

- **Grocery Stores:** lowest sales, tight distribution, median near $0  
- **Supermarket Type 3:** highest median sales, wide range  
- **Supermarket Type 1:** second-highest median sales, wide range  
- **Supermarket Type 2:** similar range to Type 1 & 3 but lower median  

> **Insight:** While Supermarket Type 1 is the most frequent, **Supermarket Type 3** achieves the highest average sales, and Grocery Stores perform the lowest.

#### Heatmap Analysis: Average Product Sales by Outlet Type and Location

**Key Observations:**

- **Supermarket Type 3** in **Tier 3** locations: highest average sales **$3,694**  
- **Supermarket Type 1:** consistent across all tiers **$2,299‚Äì$2,324**  
- **Supermarket Type 2:** appears only in Tier 3, avg. sales **$1,995**  
- **Grocery Stores:** extremely low sales in Tier 1 (**$340**) and Tier 3 (**$339**)  

**Location Insights:**

- Tier 3: high potential; performance depends on outlet type  
- Tier 1: mix of high-performing Type 1 and low-performing Grocery Stores  
- Tier 2: only Type 1 outlets present; avg. sales **$2,324**  

**Strategic Recommendation:**  
Focus on **Supermarket Type 3 in Tier 3 locations** for maximum sales. Avoid Grocery Stores in any tier.
