# Prediction-Of-Product-Sales
#  Sales Prediction for Food Items

This project focuses on predicting the sales of food items across various stores.  
The goal is to help retailers understand the properties of products and outlets that play a crucial role in increasing sales.

## üìä Project Overview
- **Objective**: Build a predictive model for `Item_Outlet_Sales` based on product and store characteristics.  
- **Data Source**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1syH81TVrbBsdymLT_jl2JIf6IjPXtSQw/view  
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Data loading and cleaning.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  3. Feature engineering and modeling.

## üìÇ Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about products and outlets, with the target variable being **Item_Outlet_Sales**.
for this Dataset there is 8523 Rows and 12 Columns
## Data Dictionary

| Variable Name              | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `Item_Identifier`           | Product ID |
| `Item_Weight`               | Weight of product |
| `Item_Fat_Content`          | Whether the product is low-fat or regular |
| `Item_Visibility`           | % of display area allocated to the product |
| `Item_Type`                 | Category of the product |
| `Item_MRP`                  | Maximum Retail Price (list price) |
| `Outlet_Identifier`         | Store ID |
| `Outlet_Establishment_Year` | Year the store was established |
| `Outlet_Size`               | Store size (ground area covered) |
| `Outlet_Location_Type`      | Type of city in which store is located |
| `Outlet_Type`               | Type of outlet (grocery, supermarket, etc.) |
| `Item_Outlet_Sales`         | **Target variable**: Sales of the product |

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Data Cleaning
Using **Pandas** to prepare the dataset for analysis:
1. Checked the number of rows and columns.  
2. Inspected datatypes of each variable.  
3. Removed duplicate.  
4. Identified missing values and replaced them with placeholder values.  
5. Ensured there are no missing values after cleaning.  
6. Standardized categorical entries (e.g., fixing inconsistencies in `Item_Fat_Content`).  
7. Generated summary statistics for numerical features (min, max, mean, etc.).  

---

## üìà Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Created different plots to explore the dataset: 
Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** Wrapper 

- **Histograms** ‚Üí to view distributions of numerical features.  
- **Boxplots** ‚Üí to visualize statistical summaries and outliers.  
- **Countplots** ‚Üí to check frequency distributions of categorical features.  
- **Heatmap** ‚Üí to see correlations between numerical variables.

## üîç Key Insights from Visuals
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Invistegating the Outlet Location Type 

### Plot 1: Outlet_Location_Type Count
<img width="590" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43e60c2b-e7a2-4c96-b4b8-1ec8957d0528" />

- Shows the number of outlets in each tier.  
- **Tier 3:** ~3,400 outlets (highest)  
- **Tier 2:** ~2,800 outlets  
- **Tier 1:** ~2,400 outlets (lowest)  

> **Insight:** Tier 3 outlets are the most common, but this plot doesn‚Äôt indicate sales performance.

### Plot 2: Outlet_Location_Type vs. Item_Outlet_Sales

<img width="589" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fec295c-21b2-4925-9cdb-2d09e9e194fc" />

- Combines a strip plot (individual sales) with a box plot (distribution summary).  
- **Tier 3:** Highest median sales, wide spread, some outliers > $12,000  
- **Tier 1 & Tier 2:** Lower median sales, fewer extreme outliers  

> **Insight:** While Tier 3 outlets are the most frequent, they also tend to generate the **highest sales**, showing a strong link between outlet type and performance.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Invistegating the Outlet Type 
## Plot 1: Outlet_Type Count
<img width="590" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc51bcf-e67a-4c99-8a08-20c97ef8b818" />
## Outlet Analysis
This bar chart shows the frequency of each outlet type in the dataset:

- **Supermarket Type 1** is by far the most common, with a count of over 5,000.
- **Supermarket Type 2**, **Grocery Store**, and **Supermarket Type 3** are much less common, each with counts around 1,000.

**Insight:** The dataset is heavily skewed towards Supermarket Type 1 outlets.

## Plot 2: Outlet_Type vs. Item_Outlet_Sales
<img width="589" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67a5c883-c62f-49a8-9289-bbd35d1558cf" />

This plot combines a strip plot with a box plot overlay to show the relationship between outlet type and sales:

- **Grocery Stores** have the lowest sales, with a very tight distribution and median sales close to zero, indicating low performance.
- **Supermarket Type 3** has the highest median sales and a wide range of sales, with some outlets achieving very high sales.
- **Supermarket Type 1** has the second-highest median sales and a wide distribution, performing better than Supermarket Type 2 and Grocery Stores, but not as well as Supermarket Type 3.
- **Supermarket Type 2** has a similar sales range to Supermarket Type 1 and Type 3, but its median sales are lower.

**Summary:** Although Supermarket Type 1 is the most frequent outlet, **Supermarket Type 3** achieves the highest sales on average, while **Grocery Stores** perform the lowest.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Invistegating the Relation between the Location & Type Vs. Item Outlet sales  

<img width="762" height="518" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3363036-2b67-479a-a399-d196a759e9e4" />

 [plot.html](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22300171/plot.html)

`Item_MRP` has the strongest positive correlation with `Item_Outlet_Sales`, indicating that price plays a significant role in sales prediction.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Feature engineering to improve data quality.  
- Training predictive models to estimate sales.  
- Evaluating performance with regression metrics.
