## üß† Machine Learning Model Development

### 1. Preprocessing the Data
Before training the models, the dataset was prepared for machine learning through several preprocessing steps:
- **Feature Selection:** Independent variables (features) were selected from the dataset, while the target variable was the `Item_Outlet_Sales`.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing data was treated appropriately to ensure model consistency and accuracy.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Categorical features were encoded into numerical form to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Feature Scaling:** Continuous features were scaled to standardize the data and improve model performance.
- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate model generalization.

### 2. Model 1 ‚Äì Linear Regression
The first model implemented was **Linear Regression**, a simple baseline model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
- It provided a reference point for evaluating more complex models.
- While easy to interpret, its performance was limited due to the presence of nonlinear patterns and categorical interactions within the data.

### 3. Model 2 ‚Äì Random Forest Regressor
Next, a **Random Forest Regressor** was trained to capture nonlinear relationships and feature interactions.
- Random Forest, being an ensemble method of decision trees, improved prediction accuracy compared to Linear Regression.
- It reduced overfitting through averaging multiple trees and was more robust to noise in the dataset.
- Feature importance values were extracted to identify which features most influenced the sales prediction.

### 4. Model 3 ‚Äì Tuned Random Forest (GridSearchCV)
To further enhance model performance, **GridSearchCV** was used to perform hyperparameter tuning on the Random Forest model.
- Parameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split` were optimized.
- The tuning process selected the combination that yielded the best performance on validation data.
- This model achieved the lowest error metrics and demonstrated the best balance between bias and variance.

### 5. Model Evaluation
All models were evaluated using standard regression metrics:
- **R¬≤ Score:** To measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** To assess the model‚Äôs prediction accuracy.  

| Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE | Remarks |
|:------|:----------|:------|:---------|
| Linear Regression | Baseline performance | Moderate error | Simple and interpretable |
| Random Forest | Improved accuracy | Lower error | Captured nonlinear relationships |
| Tuned Random Forest | Highest accuracy | Lowest error | Best overall performance |

### ‚úÖ Summary
The **Tuned Random Forest Regressor** outperformed the other models and was chosen as the final model for predicting product sales. It effectively captured complex feature interactions and delivered reliable predictions, making it well-suited for real-world sales forecasting.
