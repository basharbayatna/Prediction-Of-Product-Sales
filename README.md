# Prediction of Product Sales üçéüõí
## Sales Prediction for Food Items

This project focuses on predicting the sales of multiple items across various stores. The goal is to help retailers understand which product and store characteristics drive sales. Additionally, the analysis aims to answer **critical business questions** to guide strategic decisions, such as which outlet types and locations maximize sales, which outlets are most reliable, and where to focus expansion or marketing efforts for optimal profitability.

- **Data Source:** [Download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1syH81TVrbBsdymLT_jl2JIf6IjPXtSQw/view)  
- **Key Tasks:**
  1. Data loading and cleaning  
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  3. Feature engineering and modeling

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning
Using **Pandas**, the dataset was prepared for analysis by:

1. Checking the number of rows and columns  
2. Inspecting datatypes of each variable  
3. Removing duplicates  
4. Identifying missing values and replacing them with placeholder values  
5. Ensuring no missing values remain after cleaning  
6. Standardizing categorical entries (e.g., fixing inconsistencies in `Item_Fat_Content`)  
7. Generating summary statistics for numerical features  

---

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:

- **Histograms** ‚Üí visualize distributions of numerical features  
- **Boxplots** ‚Üí show statistical summaries and detect outliers  
- **Countplots** ‚Üí check frequency distributions of categorical features  
- **Heatmap** ‚Üí examine correlations between numerical variables  

### üìå Business Questions

1. Which outlet types are most common?  
2. Which outlet types generate the highest sales?  
3. How does location impact sales?  
4. How do outlet type and location interact to affect sales?  
5. Which outlets are consistently reliable?  
6. Where should a business focus to maximize profitability?

## üîç Key Insights

### Outlet Location Type

<img width="589" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fec295c-21b2-4925-9cdb-2d09e9e194fc" />


- The Outlet_Type is the most significant factor influencing sales performance. Both Supermarket Type3 and Supermarket Type1 demonstrate the highest average sales and substantial potential for peak sales. Conversely, Grocery Stores consistently show a drastically lower average and maximum sales, indicating they are the weakest-performing outlet category.


### Outlet Type

- The Outlet_Location_Type has little effect on an item's typical sales value, as the average sales are remarkably consistent across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations. However, Tier 3 locations are associated with the highest individual sales points, suggesting that while they don't boost average performance, they do host the most successful, high-volume transactions.

## üí° Strategic Recommendation
- Focus on **Supermarket Type 3 in Tier 3 locations** for maximum sales  
- Use **Supermarket Type 1** for stable sales across all tiers  
- Avoid **Grocery Stores**

# üîç Feature Inspection
Before modeling, features were inspected for:

- Data type  
- Missing values  
- Cardinality  
- Relationship with target variable (`Item_Outlet_Sales`)  

**Examples:**
- **Outlet_Size:** Ordinal, some missing values, mild predictor  
- **Outlet_Location_Type:** Ordinal, no missing values, slight predictor

# üß† Machine Learning: Item Outlet Sales Prediction

## 1. Data Preprocessing
- Dropped unnecessary columns (`Item_Identifier`)  
- Handled missing values (`Outlet_Size`)  
- Train-test split with fixed random state  
- Feature transformation pipelines:  
  - Numerical ‚Üí median imputation + standard scaling  
  - Ordinal ‚Üí most frequent imputation + ordered encoding + scaling  
  - Categorical ‚Üí constant imputation + one-hot encoding  
- Unified preprocessing using `ColumnTransformer`
