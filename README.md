# üîç Feature Inspection

Before modeling, a feature inspection step was conducted to understand the nature of each feature and its relationship with the target (`Item_Outlet_Sales`).  

- **Outlet_Size:** Ordinal feature with some missing values; imputed appropriately. Mild predictor of sales.  
- **Outlet_Location_Type:** Ordinal feature with no missing values; shows a slight relationship with sales.  

Other features were inspected similarly to determine data type, missing values, cardinality, and potential impact on the target. This step helped guide preprocessing choices such as imputation, encoding, and scaling.

# üß† Machine Learning Project: Item Outlet Sales Prediction

## 1. Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent a comprehensive preprocessing stage to ensure model accuracy and reliability:

- **Dropped unnecessary columns:** Removed `Item_Identifier` due to high cardinality.
- **Handled missing values:** Replaced `'MISSING'` entries in `Outlet_Size` with `NaN`.
- **Train‚ÄìTest Split:** Data was split into training and testing sets with a fixed random state for reproducibility.
- **Feature Transformation Pipelines:**
  - **Numerical Features:** Median imputation followed by standard scaling.
  - **Ordinal Features:** Imputed using the most frequent value, encoded with a defined order, and scaled.
  - **Categorical Features:** Imputed using a constant value and one-hot encoded.
- All transformations were unified using a single `ColumnTransformer`, ensuring consistent preprocessing across models.

## 2. Model Development

Three regression models were trained and compared to predict **Item Outlet Sales**:

### üîπ Linear Regression
A baseline model assuming a linear relationship between features and sales.

| Dataset | MAE | RMSE | R¬≤ |
|----------|------|------|------|
| **Train** | 847.15 | 1139.13 | 0.562 |
| **Test** | 804.09 | 1092.73 | 0.567 |

üß© **Interpretation:**  
Linear Regression provided a simple, interpretable baseline. However, it showed clear underfitting, indicating the data contained nonlinear relationships the model couldn‚Äôt capture.

---

### üîπ Random Forest Regressor
An ensemble model capable of capturing nonlinear interactions and complex feature dependencies.

| Dataset | MAE | RMSE | R¬≤ |
|----------|------|------|------|
| **Train** | 296.23 | 426.54 | 0.939 |
| **Test** | 765.91 | 1102.14 | 0.560 |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Observation:**  
The Random Forest achieved near-perfect training accuracy but performed similarly to the baseline on the test set, indicating **overfitting**.

---

### üîπ Tuned Random Forest Regressor (After GridSearchCV)
A hyperparameter-optimized version of the Random Forest model.  
Parameters such as tree depth, number of estimators, and sample split criteria were fine-tuned to balance bias and variance.

| Dataset | MAE | RMSE | R¬≤ |
|----------|------|------|------|
| **Train** | 755.44 | 1073.75 | 0.610 |
| **Test** | 728.49 | 1046.52 | 0.603 |

‚úÖ **Interpretation:**  
After tuning, the model achieved **better generalization** ‚Äî reducing overfitting and improving performance on unseen data.  
The R¬≤ score improved from **0.56 ‚Üí 0.60**, and MAE decreased from **766 ‚Üí 728**, indicating stronger predictive accuracy.

## 3. Model Comparison Summary

| Model | Train R¬≤ | Test R¬≤ | Test MAE | Test RMSE | Notes |
|:------|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:------|
| Linear Regression | 0.562 | 0.567 | 804.09 | 1092.73 | Baseline model, interpretable but underfits |
| Random Forest | 0.939 | 0.560 | 765.91 | 1102.14 | Overfitted, poor generalization |
| Tuned Random Forest | 0.610 | 0.603 | 728.49 | 1046.52 | Best balance of bias and variance |

## 4. Evaluation and Recommendations

- The **Linear Regression model** served as a good baseline but lacked the ability to capture complex patterns.  
- The **Untuned Random Forest** significantly overfit, showing excellent training performance but weak generalization.  
- The **Tuned Random Forest Regressor** delivered the best overall results, with improved test performance and reduced overfitting.  
- This final model explains roughly **60% of the variance in sales** and predicts within **\$728 of the true value** on average.

üìä **Final Recommendation:**  
Deploy the **Tuned Random Forest Model** as the production-ready solution.  
Future improvements could include:
- More feature engineering (interaction terms, sales seasonality, regional trends)
- Cross-validation with more folds for stability
- Exploration of advanced ensemble models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or LightGBM)

---

### ‚úÖ Summary
> The **Tuned Random Forest Regressor** achieved the best performance and generalization, making it the most reliable choice for predicting item outlet sales in this project.
